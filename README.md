-Some files can randomly appear in the project files that were previously deleted. If unsure about which file is meant to be there. Please check the game objects in the hierarchy to see if the assets or scripts are also in there (These files may also be in the assets section of this repository).

-Unfortunately, in the c# scripts, I have not highlighted in italics the names of the scripts that I have borrowed from tutorial videos as is mentioned in the Computer Programs template for Harvard Referencing. As I could not find an option for italics in the text editor.

-If on startup you have an error that is due to a script. You will need to delete that script in the project console ONLY IF it is not a component for any game objects in the project.
